# NYC Bike Violations 

## Introduction

Cycling is... While one can find a great deal of information about general cycling in NYC, it is harder to find information specifically about bike tickets.

Throughout this report, I will use the term 'cyclist' to refer to regular bike riders, ebike riders, and escooter riders and 'bicycle' to refer to any of the vehicles that falls under these labels.

## Data

The datasets used were all taken from the NYC Open Data website, except the violation code description data, which was taken from the NY DMV website. The violation data was merged from two different datasets, a 'year to date' dataset spanning Jan 1, 2023 to June 30th, 2023, and a 'historical' dataset dating from Jan 1, 2018 to December 31, 2022. These datasets contained all violations issued by the NYPD, but only the violations labeled 'Bike', 'Ebike', and 'Escooter' were chosen for this report. The bicycle count data was agglomerated per day and per week, and these values were appended to the merged violations dataset. The violation code description data was also merged with the violations dataset, so that a textual description of the violation code could easily be accessed.
